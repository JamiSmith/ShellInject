- After completing each task, update agent/tasks.md to check it off.
- Keep commits scoped to the task you just completed.
- Commit after each completed task with a concise message focused on the why.
- If you need to make assumptions, document them in agent/plan.md.

Completion:
- When all tasks are checked, output exactly: <promise>COMPLETED</promise>
